## Introduction

Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained significant attention in recent years, especially with advancements in deep learning. The transformer model, originally designed for natural language processing, has shown promise in various domains, including RL. This repository focuses on harnessing the power of transformers to improve decision-making processes in RL environments.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: The codebase is organized for easy modifications and extensions.
- **Performance**: Leveraging transformer architecture to enhance learning efficiency.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for various RL environments, from simple to complex.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples to help users get started quickly.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Carnetemperrado/x-transformers-rl.git
   cd x-transformers-rl
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure you have `x-transformers` installed. You can install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install x-transformers
   ```

## Usage

To get started with the transformer model for reinforcement learning, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/Carnetemperrado/x-transformers-rl/releases) section.
2. Execute the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

This will initialize the model and start the training process.

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the transformer used in this repository is based on the standard transformer model with modifications to suit RL tasks. Key components include:

- **Encoder**: Processes the input states and encodes them into a latent space.
- **Decoder**: Generates actions based on the encoded states.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Focuses on relevant parts of the input to improve decision-making.

## Training

Training the model involves several steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your environment is set up with appropriate states and rewards.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjust learning rates, batch sizes, and other parameters in `config.py`.
3. **Run Training**: Use the command:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

During training, the model will save checkpoints that can be used for evaluation or further training.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the trained model, use the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path <path_to_model>
```

Replace `<path_to_model>` with the path to your saved model checkpoint.
